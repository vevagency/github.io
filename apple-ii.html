  <p>The <strong>Apple II</strong> (stylized as <strong>Apple ][</strong>) is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak. Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply.</p>

  <p>The computer included a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor running at 1.023 MHz, two game paddles (no longer bundled as of 1980 because they violated <abbr title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</abbr> regulations), 4 KB of <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr>, an audio cassette interface for loading programs and storing data, and the Integer BASIC programming language built into the <abbr title="Read Only Memory">ROM</abbr>s. To reflect the computer's color graphics capability, the Apple logo on the casing has rainbow stripes, which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998.</p>

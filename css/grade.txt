Be sure you review the these corrections. You will need to understand how to use these in order to work on your final project.

CORRECTIONS:

(None, really.)

- Code not properly indented, nested



NOTES:

Outstanding job. Beautiful design. Love the font, color choices. It all works so well together. You have the rare case where centering is okay. Well done!

I think the only adjustment I might try is the line height on the text inside Education, Experience. I checked -- 0.8 is really compressing that text and maybe making it a little more difficult to read. This might also be a solution to what I mentioned during office hours about breaking down your roles (i.e. Marketing, Website Coordinator, etc). I could not quite pinpoint why it looked okay, but not entirely okay. I couldn't put my finger on it then. Seeing the line-height now, I think that's what it may be. So experiment. Maybe try 1.1? 1.2?

The only thing to work on (from the rubric) is properly indenting/nesting code.

Well done. Looking forward to seeing the final project.

# READ ME

## Building Web Pages


### Objectives

- Become familiar with creating HTML page structure
- Process raw information and decide how to format it with HTML
- Develop a workflow for building and linking multiple pages


### Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking "Clone or Download". Select "Download ZIP".

Included in the `exercise-01` (or `exercise-01-master`) directory are the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- apple-ii.jpg
- apple-ii.txt
- commodore-64.jpg
- commodore-64.txt
- main-content.txt
- trs-80.jpg
- trs-80.txt

Do not move any files outside of this directory.

Add new files to the `exercise-01` directory.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


### Tasks

1. Create a file, `index.html`. Add the document structure for your web page. This should include `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags. Make sure your code is properly nested.

2. Add the content from `main-content.txt` to `index.html`. You may copy and paste the text into the document (never copy and paste code). Text within square brackets (`[` and`]`) are notes about the content and should not appear on the page.

  Format the content using appropriate semantic tags. This includes: headings, paragraphs, images and lists.

  Photo caption text should be emphasized.

  Strongly emphasize the computer name (and any 'nicknames') on first reference in the paragraphs.

  Are there any abbreviations? Mark these up (first reference only), too. If you are unfamiliar with an abbreviation, look it up!

3. In `index.html`, link each item under "Microcomputers". Apple II should be linked to `apple-ii.html`; "Commodore 64" to `commodore-64.html`; and "TRS 80" to `trs-80.html`.

4. Create a file for each computer -- `apple-ii.html`, `commodore-64.html`, `trs-80.html`.

  Add the content for each computer into its respective HTML file. Format this content as you did with the text in `index.html`.

  For each item in the "Specifications" list, strongly emphasize each label (i.e. Release Date, Price, etc.).

  *Tip:* For this task, you may want to work through all content for each computer at a time, as opposed to putting one element (i.e. page title, paragraphs, lists) at a time in each file.


### How to tackle this project

**Read the task.**

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down the task to be completed. When you finish, check it off.

Decide on the next task to tackle.

It is okay if you get stuck. Set aside the task giving you trouble, decide on another and move on. Be sure you have written down the task giving you trouble (so you can spend time on it later).


### Am I done?

It is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class. If you finish, have your professor give it a look. If you *are* finished, delete your work and code it again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.


### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

  - Did I forget to close a tag?
  - Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
  - Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
  - Are my file names, directory paths correct?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
